# Custom Server Pack for DayZ | 1.25 |


Transform your DayZ server experience with our meticulously crafted XML configuration, designed to revolutionize loot management.
Simple Plug And Play Server Pack ( with everything you need )

By assigning specific usage tags to each event and area,
such as "ContaminatedArea," "Riffy," "TrainCrash," and more,
we've eliminated the need for deloot="1" and streamlined the entire loot distribution process.

After extensive testing and refinement over the course of approximately a month,
Ive fine-tuned every detail to ensure good functionality.

I discovered that providing a tag for every item and setting deloot="1" to 0 across the board is essential for optimal performance, rather than just a few isolated instances.
This then allows us to assign custom uage tags to the types entrys and proto entrys where we wish loot to be each event now have its own usage tag so its easy to select what items you would like at each event,
the great thing about this is that you can also have a item that spawns at a helli crash only also spawn in tier4 for example you have full control.

Ive separated "Riffy" and Pavlovo contaminated, each with its own carefully curated loot pool.

Additionally, we've enhanced the player experience with, Extra colored weapons and hidden items

In summary, our custom XML configuration represents a significant leap forward in loot management,
gameplay balance, and overall player engagement for your DayZ server. It's a testament to our dedication and attention to detail.
